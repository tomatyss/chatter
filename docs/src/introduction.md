# Introduction

Chatter is a Rust-powered terminal client for exploring large language models. It offers a familiar chat workflow for Google's Gemini API and local Ollama models, complete with streaming output, session management, and an opt-in autonomous agent mode for filesystem tasks.

This book walks you through installing, configuring, and extending Chatter. It expands on the project README with deeper explanations, practical examples, and development notes to help you adapt the tool to your workflow.
